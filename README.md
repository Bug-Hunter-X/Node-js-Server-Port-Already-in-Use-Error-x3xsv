# Node.js Server Port Already in Use Error

This repository demonstrates a common Node.js error: 'listen EADDRINUSE'. This occurs when your server tries to bind to a port that's already occupied by another process (e.g., another instance of your server, or a different application).

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file offers a solution.
